# Milton Aguiar — website

Portfolio site for comic book artist Milton Aguiar ([@miltonaguiarart](https://www.instagram.com/miltonaguiarart/)).

Built with Vite, React 19, React Router, Framer Motion and Lenis. Fonts are bundled with the site.
Content is edited through an admin panel at `/admin` (see below).

## Run it

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5175
npm run build      # production build in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

## Pages

| Route | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home: the name and a drawing in the title panel of a comic page, the current project, latest pieces as panels, gallery, step-by-step comparisons, commissions, conventions |
| `/work` | Every piece, with category filters; a piece opens large with its details |
| `/gallery` | Pictures in sections, shown uncropped: finished pieces, pencilled pages, whatever is added |
| `/commissions` | What is on offer, how it works, and the request form |
| `/about` | Who Milton is, quick facts, where to find him |
| `/contact` | Contact form, email and social links |

## Edit the content: the admin panel

The site is edited at **`/admin`** (for example `https://your-site.com/admin/`).
It is a content manager (Decap CMS) that saves every change as a commit to this repository.
The site rebuilds itself about a minute later. No code involved.

| Section | What you control |
|---|---|
| Work | Every piece: picture, title, category, date, link to the post, a note, whether it is on the home page |
| Gallery | Sections of the gallery page and the pictures in each. A section can also fill itself from Work, so a finished piece is only uploaded once. Tick "Show on the home page" on up to 6 pictures |
| Step by step | Sets of one piece at each stage (pencils, inks, colours), or an old drawing next to its redraw: a name and a picture for each stage |
| Conventions | Events, with dates and where to find the table |
| Home page, Work and Gallery pages, Commissions page, About page, Contact page | The words on each page, one short form per page: headings, introductions, buttons. The Home page form also holds the drawing beside the name, the current project (title, cover, where to read it) and which layout the gallery opens in; the Commissions form holds open or closed, the offers and prices |
| Name, colour and contact | Site name, tagline, brand colour, logo, email, social links, footer text |
| Show or hide | Switch whole pages, or parts of the home page, on and off |

Pictures upload straight from the panel into `public/uploads/`. A piece without a picture gets a
blank art board with its title, so the site never shows a hole.

Every piece, gallery section, set and event also has a **Hide from the site** switch, which takes it off the site
without deleting it.

### The drawing beside the name

Home page → Drawing. A cut-out (a PNG or WebP with a see-through background) stands in the title
panel in front of a burst of the brand colour. Any other picture is laid in the panel as a sheet of
art board. The site tells the two apart by itself.

### Editing on this computer

```
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5175/admin/ and edit; changes land directly in `content/`.
(`npm run dev` also starts the small helper the panel saves through, on port 8083.)

### Editing files by hand

Everything the panel edits is plain JSON under `content/`. Editing those files and pushing
has the same effect as using the panel.

## Design

- The site is drawn as a comic page: panels ruled in ink, lettered caption boxes, speech balloons, print dots.
- It opens **dark** (a black page ruled in white ink). The switch in the top bar changes to the light theme (black ink on art-board paper); the visitor's choice is remembered in their browser.
- Tokens (colours, type, spacing) for both themes are at the top of `src/styles/global.css`.
- The one colour on the site is set by a hue, `--h`, from **Name, colour and contact → Brand colour**. 25 is the red of the logo.
- Wherever a set of pictures is shown (the home page gallery, the Gallery page) visitors can switch between four layouts: wall, grid, strip and spotlight.
- The browser icon, the icon a phone uses when the site is added to its home screen (`public/manifest.webmanifest`) and the mark in the top bar are all the logo.
- Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: smooth scroll, the opening sheet and the moving band switch off.

## Deploy on Vercel (site and admin)

`vercel.json` holds the build settings and routing, so the site itself needs no setup:

1. On vercel.com: **Add New → Project**, import this GitHub repository, press **Deploy**.

The admin at `/admin/` needs two values. It logs in with **a passcode you choose**, and the site
saves changes to GitHub with **a token of its own** (the small files in `/api`). Nobody logging
in needs a GitHub account.

2. Make the token, once, with the GitHub account that owns this repository:
   **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new
   token**. Repository access: **Only select repositories** → this repository.
   Permissions → Repository permissions → **Contents: Read and write**. Generate and copy it.
3. On Vercel: project **Settings → Environment Variables**, add
   `ADMIN_PASSCODE` (the passcode: long and hard to guess, 12 characters or more) and
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the token from step 2), then **Deployments → Redeploy**.

To change the passcode later, change `ADMIN_PASSCODE` on Vercel and redeploy; everyone is
logged out and uses the new one. A login lasts a week. Pictures uploaded through the admin on
Vercel can be about 3 MB at most.

Every **Save** in the admin is a commit to the branch the site was built from; Vercel rebuilds
and the change is live about a minute later. In a browser that is logged in to the admin, the
site shows anything saved since its last build straight away (`api/content.js`).

Any other static host works for the site itself: build command `npm run build`, output directory
`dist`, SPA fallback to `index.html`. On Netlify the admin can use Netlify Identity with Git
Gateway instead of the passcode (`netlify.toml` is included).
