/* Commissions, for the customer and for the admin. One function for all of it (Vercel's plan
   allows 12), chosen by `action`, always POST. What is kept is described in api/_commissions.js.

   The customer (logged in; customer accounts must be on):
     { action: 'request', kind, idea, refs, size, budget, due }   a new commission; the artist is emailed
                                                                 (only while commissions are open)

     { action: 'get', id }                                       one, with its thread (marks it read)
     { action: 'message', id, text, links }                      a message to the artist
     { action: 'pay', id, provider: 'card' | 'paypal' }          accept the quote: answers { url } of the payment page
     { action: 'capture', id, order }                            back from PayPal: the payment is taken
     { action: 'cancel', id }                                    while it is not paid
     { action: 'confirm', id }                                   "I've received it": delivered becomes complete,

     { action: 'remove', ids, password }                         out of their account, after a copy of each is
                                                                 emailed (nothing goes if it cannot be sent): an

     'pay' also takes `code`: a discount code, checked again here (a reward code only for its owner)
   The admin (Sales → Orders → Commissions; their pass, or localhost on this computer):

     { action: 'adminReopen', id }                               a completed one back to delivered (they are told)

     { action: 'adminDeliver', id, upload, note, link }          the finished files emailed to the customer
