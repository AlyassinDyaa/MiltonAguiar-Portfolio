/* The cart. What a visitor has added is kept in their browser (so it survives a reload), as
   { slug, size, signed, qty } lines (size: the print size, for a piece sold in sizes). Every time it is read it is checked against the site's content:
   a piece that has sold out, been hidden or lost its price drops out, and prices always come
   from the content, never from what was stored. The checkout reads the prices again itself.
   With a customer logged in, the cart is the account's: it arrives with the login (joined with
   whatever was added before logging in), every change is saved to the account, and logging out
   empties it on this device.
   Paying: what goes to the payment page is noted first (notePaying, in data/checkout.js). Back from
   paying, settle() takes exactly those lines out of the cart, also when the account's saved cart
   arrives a moment later (the server takes them out of the saved cart too, once paid).
   A discount code typed into the cart is checked by the site (api/discount.js) and kept for this
   visit: subtotal is what the pieces come to, off what the code takes off, total what is paid. */
